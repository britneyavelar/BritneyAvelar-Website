        <div class="subheading mb-5">Spanish Department</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Britney Avelar and I am a first generation student from a Central American household, born and raised in Los Angeles, California.. My parents are both immigrants from Central America that arrived to the United States during their teenage years, and their migration is an obvious impact on how I view the world and also, without a doubt, plays part in many of the choices I make. Witnessing the different struggles that many people face daily, such as that of my parent’s immigration status, I always felt the need to provide a solution, to find the light in these dire circumstances, to do what I could to make the situation better. From a young age I volunteered at many fundraisers for Central American children and families by collecting donations, such as toys and clothes, as well as singing at the events with my father. I believe this is where I truly realized that I had a strong desire to help people. Aside from these fundraising events, I joined an internship at the United Church University, formerly founded at the University of Southern California, where I was a youth intern and later an assistant teacher. At this internship we managed a weekend and summer camp called Peace Camp, children of the community, of ages 4 – 18 were enrolled with the objective of creating a safe space for them and teaching them about the most peaceful ways to deal with the problems within their life and the world. These experiences in my life have all helped me to realize that I wanted to help children, specifically those from a life similar to mine, with immigrant parents, first generation students, etc. And having immigrant parents, experiencing the culture of not belonging entirely to the United States or to Central America because I was simply a mixture of both. Growing up this way I struggled with my identity until I decided to embrace my Latin roots, specifically my learning the Spanish language to the best of my ability, and embracing the culture itself. With these realizations I have come to the conclusion that I want to become a high school Spanish teacher. Teaching Spanish will allow me to share my culture with those who are not part of it and hopefully teach others who are also Latinx to embrace their culture and its language. Evidently, teaching high school students will allow me to hopefully pass on my knowledge to students during this pivotal time in their life.<br><br>
